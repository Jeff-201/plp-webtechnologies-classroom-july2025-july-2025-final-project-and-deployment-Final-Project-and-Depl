# Solara Studio — Multipage Website (starter)

## Purpose
Portfolio / services website built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Mobile-first, accessible, and ready for static hosting.

## Structure
- `index.html` — Home
- `about.html` — About / team
- `services.html` — Services offered
- `contact.html` — Contact form
- `css/styles.css` — all styles
- `js/main.js` — small client scripts
- `images/` — images and assets

## How to run locally
1. Clone the repo
2. Serve with a static server (or open `index.html` directly)
   - Quick: `npx http-server` (if you have NodeJS) or use VS Code Live Server

## Deployment
- GitHub Pages: push to `main` branch and enable GitHub Pages (or push to `gh-pages` branch).
- Netlify / Vercel: Connect your repo and deploy.

## Notes
- Replace images in `images/`
- Replace logo `images/logo.svg`
- For production form handling, integrate Netlify Forms, Formspree, or a backend endpoint.
